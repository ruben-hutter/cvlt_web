# CVLT Web - Project Context

## What is this?
The paragliding club website [cvlt.ch](https://cvlt.ch) for **Club Volo Libero Ticino**.
The site is live in production. Current work is iterating on details and adding features following `TODO.md` and `plans/`.

## Production Setup
- **Production**: `cvlt.ch` — pulls from `main` branch (Infomaniak hosting)
- `dev` branch is the working branch — tested locally, then merged to `main` for production deploy

## Tech Stack (not negotiable)
| Layer | Tech |
|:---|:---|
| Framework | **Next.js** (latest, App Router) |
| CMS | **Payload 3.0** (embedded in Next.js) |
| Database | **SQLite** via `@payloadcms/db-sqlite` |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS** |
| Runtime | **Node.js 24 LTS** |
| Email | **Nodemailer** via Infomaniak SMTP (transactional) |
| Hosting | **Infomaniak** shared hosting (one Node.js process per site) |

## Key Architecture Notes
- Payload admin panel at `/admin`
- SQLite DB file on disk — in `.gitignore`, backed up via prebuild script (keeps last 30)
- Analytics: GoatCounter (privacy-friendly, no cookies)
- Security: CSP headers, rate limiting, 2FA on all admin users, XSS escaping

## Language
Italian only. Multilingual possible in the future (see TODO.md).

## Repo & Hosting
- GitHub repo: `cvlt_web` (public, Ruben's account)
- Infomaniak install method: **Git** (HTTPS clone URL in Infomaniak panel)
- Infomaniak plan: Web hosting 250GB / 20 sites / ~130 CHF/year

## Design Direction
Modern, clean, fast. Tailwind utility classes.

## Working Conventions
- Follow `TODO.md` for current priorities and `plans/` for planned features
- The `plans/` directory contains research/plan documents for upcoming work

## Git & Worktree Setup

This project uses **git worktrees**. The branches live in separate directories:

| Branch | Directory | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `main` | `/home/ruben/repos/cvlt_web` | Production (cvlt.ch) |
| `dev` | `/home/ruben/repos/cvlt_web-dev` | Development (local) |
| `feat/*` | `/home/ruben/repos/cvlt_web-*` | Feature branches |

### Deploy pipeline
1. Work on `dev` branch (current directory is the dev worktree)
2. Test locally with `npm run dev`
3. Merge into `main` → deploys to `cvlt.ch`

### How to merge into main from the dev worktree
```bash
git -C /home/ruben/repos/cvlt_web merge dev
git -C /home/ruben/repos/cvlt_web push origin main
```
Do NOT `git checkout main` in the dev worktree. Always operate on the main worktree via `git -C`.

### Commit conventions
- Commit messages in English, imperative mood (e.g. "add contact section")
- Always run lint and typecheck before committing
- Never force push. Never use `--no-verify`.

## Build & Dev Commands
- `npm run dev` — dev server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` — production build (includes Payload importmap generation)
- `npm run start` — production start
- Lint: `npx next lint` (or check package.json scripts)
- Typecheck: `npx tsc --noEmit`

## Screenshot Feedback
When the user shares a screenshot during a session, automatically check it against the latest changes to provide visual feedback. Screenshots are saved to `~/Pictures/Screenshots/`.
